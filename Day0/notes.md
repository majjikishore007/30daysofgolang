# Basics 

## Go Environmet 


### Go Path

- Go is opinionated 
- all the go code by convention lives in single workspace(folder)
- by default the go will asume that the workspace is in the `~/go` or `$HOME/go` folder
- Go places its file in 3 differnt directories
    - `src` : source code
    - `pkg` : packages objects
    - `bin` : compiled programs

### Go modules

- Go modules are introduced in go 1.11
- Go modules make life easier by managing the dependencies, verions and the packages
- They enable users to run go code outside of the `GOPATH`
